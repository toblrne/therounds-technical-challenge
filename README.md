### Tech Stack
Next.js, TypeScript, React, Jest

### to run the project:

```
npm run dev
```

### to run the tests:

```
npm run test
```

### Accessiblity Features
- user feedback using the react-hot-toast package (notifications on submit and errors)
- some input validation in the API request itself
- form used for input
- if I had more time and the application was more complex, I would have made the application responsive


### Production
Some other things that might be useful to implement if I had more time
- more expansive tests
- secure user authentication for application security
- rate limiting (if not implemented already in the API) to prevent abuse
